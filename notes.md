Fitt's law ( for pointing devices):
a + b * log2(A/W + 1)
A = amplitude, W = width
Josephus Problem (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCsD3ZGzMgE). For a length of n, the survivor is at 2*l + 1, where n = 2^a + l, and a is the max possible value. A much faster way is to take n in binary and rotate right, and place the leading binary 1 at the lsb.
